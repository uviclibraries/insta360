# Exporting and Publishing your 360 Video
_Note: Local is where your edits are and camera is the original footage_

**Brittany: Please add some images to help learners...**

1. Exporting
- Select the footage you wish to export (probably under local as that is where the edited footage is located).
- Click the square with the arrow pointing towards the corner (third icon on the top). This is your exporting button. 
- You can save to your camera roll by clicking album or to the desired platform (Community, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Street View, Messenger, Twitter, Link) you wish to share your video with. 

2. Choose Video Output (360 or regular: Fix Frame)
- For  360 camera exporting, you must use VR glasses, but for Fix Frame it is for any publishing and sharing.
- Then press the check mark

3. Inserting in a blog post
- Open Wordpress or your blog page and embed your saved video or share the link. 

_Great work!_
