# Introduction to the 360 Camera 

- Hands-on activities: 60-70 min

## Why Insta 360? 

360 cameras are amazing tools that can create immersive still shots and videos that can be used for a variety of purposes. For example 360 videos can help you create an immersive tour of a location or event that you can quickly make available to the world on YouTube to be viewed in a web browser or VR goggles! Here's an example of the UVic Libraries tour with a 360 video. Make sure you click and drag around the video to "look around":

Using the Insta 360 for still shots can help you create a "choose your own adventure" 360-tour, similar to this short tour of the [Digital Scholarship Commons space in the library](https://msystems.net/dsc/){:target="_blank"}. This workshop will help you develop the skills you need to create 360 videos and take 360 still shots without damaging the lenses of the camera.

**Before any UVic students, faculty, or staff with a valid UVic OneCard can borrow a 360 camera from the library, they need to successfully complete this workshop and pass the quiz at the end of this workshop with a 100% grade.** We have made this workshop a prerequisite for borrowing our 360 cameras for two reasons:

       1. Our first 360 camera was damaged and is now unusable 
          because of improper care of the dual camera lenses.
       2. Borrowers frequently have problems using basic 360 
          camera functionality and desirable.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. **Learn how to protect the Insta360 lenses from being scratched**, see what video from a scratched lens looks like, & know how much it costs to replace a scratched lens
1. Record video with the Insta360 on a tripod and selfie stick
2. Record still images with the Insta360 on a tripod and selfie stick
