This quiz is mandatory for anyone who wishes to borrow a 360 camera from the library, they need to successfully complete this workshop and pass this quiz with a grade of 100%. We have made this workshop a prerequisite for borrowing our 360 cameras for two reasons (as mentioned in the introduction to this workshop):

- One of our 360 cameras was damaged and is now unusable because of improper care of the dual camera lenses.
- Borrowers frequently have problems using basic 360 camera functionality.
