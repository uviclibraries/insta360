_Note: there can be multiple speed changes in one video footage (you can do slow motions and moving time lapses_.

**8. Deep track**
  - Click on the deep tracking icon
  - Drag your mouse to the object you want to follow

**9. Video Options:** are located on the right hand side of the Software panel
  - Flowstate stabilization: it is best to leave it on in most cases as it makes the video smooth, for this workshop leave the default but know you can change these settings.

  - Direction lock: is useful in order to have the video follow the direction the camera
  - Stitching: only applicable if you are using accessories (lens guard, waterproof case)
  - Select stitching calibration (both dynamic stitching and chromatic calibration) 

**10. Exporting** (see the final publishing activity for more inforation)
  - Select the export icon in the upper right
  - The recommended setting is 70-100mbps, but you can also change settings here.
  - For good compression, use H.265
