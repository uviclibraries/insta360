  - On the top middle bar, select Free Capture (this will show the video as a normal video: not 360 with the ability to control the angles (reframing)
  - The first icon is the keyframe. Use keyframes to modify the angle and direction the camera is looking. Do this by dragging and scrolling or by manually setting angle parameters (bottom left side). 
  - The next is delete keyframe.
  - Deep track: tracks a moving object as long as it is visible
  - Timeshift: speeds up footage and Motion blur: available when timeshift is selected. 

**5. Reframing**
  - Scrub through the video and on the preview screen drag to where you want the view.
  - When the point has been chosen, click the keyframes

  - Play and watch to see how the keyframes look

**6. Transitions between Keyframes**
  - Click on the lines that join the keyframes, which will open the transitions settings on the bottom left side.
  - Try out various transitions.

**7. Speed**
  - Select the timeshift icon and click on the desired speed (for example: 2x)

**8. Deep track**
  - Click on the deep tracking icon
  - Drag your mouse to the object you want to follow

  - Select stitching calibration (both dynamic stitching and chromatic calibration)
